# android-talking-time-alarm
App that tells time and closes itself right after. For more easy alarm in morning.

Why snooze every time ? 
And why look in phone every time to know how much time is left until you really need to get up?

Just let the phone tell you the time! [In Hebrew]

1. Download zip from release and extract apk\*.wav.
2. Install apk and give permission if needed (does not ask by itself)
3. Copy all voices files (*.wav) to `<public storage (sd)>/Android/data/us.cpluspl.yonixw.talkingalarm/files` when public storage should be on sd, in my case it was `/storage/emulated/0`
4. Run app, if you hear the time you done!
5. Using task scheduler start the app when you wnat alarm. (I recommend Automate (Llama is outdated))
